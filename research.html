<h1>My Work</h1>
<div class="blurb">
<p>I work mainly on topics in computational plasma astrophysics related to accretion disks around supermassive black holes.  I've worked with general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of full accretion disks, but more recently have turned towards smaller scales.  I've been using particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations to try to  understand the microphysics of magnetic reconnection, with a particular focus on understanding how reconnection accelerates electrons to ultra-relativistic velocities and under what conditions it can do so.

I've also spent some time working with general-relativistic radiative transfer calculations to understand the observational signatures of what hot gas swirling around a black hole would actually look like.</p>
